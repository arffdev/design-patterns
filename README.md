# DESIGN PATTERNS

### Description
- Shows ideas behind design patterns with actual code and how you might implement them with real code examples.

## Creational Patterns
### Description
* Put simply the creation of objects efficiently depending on the situation.

### Examples
* Abstract Factory Pattern [link](https://github.com/arffdev/design-patterns/tree/master/CreationalDesignPatterns/AbstractFactoryPattern)
	* Without specifying concrete classes you can encapsulate a group of individual factories.
	* One factory could be capable of multiple actions that produce different results.
* Builder Pattern [link](https://github.com/arffdev/design-patterns/tree/master/CreationalDesignPatterns/BuilderPattern)
	* By splitting up the work to different processes/builders that are capable of creating complex objects in a simpler manner.
* Factory Method Pattern [link](https://github.com/arffdev/design-patterns/tree/master/CreationalDesignPatterns/FactoryMethodPattern)
	* Using factory methods to create objects without having to define the exact class.
* Object Pool Pattern [link](https://github.com/arffdev/design-patterns/tree/master/CreationalDesignPatterns/ObjectPoolPattern)
	* By creating an object pool a client can access that pool of already initialized objects instead of creating new objects.
	* This is a good pattern when you are really concerned about performance.
* Prototype Pattern
	* Creates "clones" from an abstract base class to create new objects.
	* Meant to avoid sublcasses like the Abstract Factory pattern.
* Singleton Pattern
	* Not implemented yet
