# DESIGN PATTERNS #

### Description ###
- Shows ideas behind design patterns with actual code and how you might implement them with real code examples.

## Creational Patterns ##
* Abstract Factory Pattern [link](https://github.com/arffdev/design-patterns/tree/master/CreationalDesignPatterns/AbstractFactoryPattern)
	* Without specifying concrete classes you can encapsulate a group of individual factories.
	* One factory could be capable of multiple actions that produce different results.
* Builder Pattern [link](https://github.com/arffdev/design-patterns/tree/master/CreationalDesignPatterns/BuilderPattern)
	* By splitting up the work to different processes/builders that are capable of creating complex objects in a simpler manner.
* Factory Method Pattern
* Prototype Pattern
* Singleton Pattern
