### Description ###
Creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, 
trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. [Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creational_pattern)

* [Abstract Factory Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_factory_pattern) - Provides an interface for creating related or dependent objects without specifying the objects' concrete classes.
	* [Example](https://github.com/arffdev/design-patterns/tree/master/CreationalDesignPatterns/AbstractFactoryPattern) 
* [Builder Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern) - Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation. By doing so the same construction process can create different representations.
